//***FILE1060 is a REXX exec that tells you information about       *   FILE1060
//*           your IODF (I/O configuration) and related items.      *   FILE1060
//*           The origin of this REXX is unknown to me, and it      *   FILE1060
//*           was originally called PROCINFO, but I changed its     *   FILE1060
//*           name to IODFINFO because that seems to be closer      *   FILE1060
//*           to its true purpose. (Author currently unknown)       *   FILE1060
